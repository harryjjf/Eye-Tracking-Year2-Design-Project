Our code is adapted from Antoine Lames open source gaze tracking repository and adapted for our use within an AAC device.
 We added up/down tracking functionality, a time delay for movements to be correctly detected and movements thresholds to control the cursor to move to specified positions on the screen. 
Modules required: Dlib, OpenCV, NumPy
