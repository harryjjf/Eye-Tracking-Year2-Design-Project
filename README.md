# Overview
Our code is adapted from [Antoine Lames open source gaze tracking repository](https://github.com/antoinelame/GazeTracking/blob/master/README.md) and adapted for our use within an AAC device.

We added up/down tracking functionality, a time delay for movements to be correctly detected and movements thresholds to control the cursor to move to specified positions on the screen. 

**Modules required:** Dlib, OpenCV, NumPy
